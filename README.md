### Hi there


### I'm Paul. I solve problems.

By day, I solve healthcare system integration problems over at [iNTERFACEWARE](https://www.interfaceware.com/), a software company based in Toronto, Canada. As a Solutions Architect, I design, build, test, and deploy various end-to-end solutions that enable the exchange of healthcare data between any system, application, or device at a speed that improves access to critical patient, administrative and financial information.

By night, I try my best to solve what I believe is [a big problem in physics education](https://physicsinmotion.ca/): how to keep students engaged in a beautiful subject that is often stigmatized as being difficult and boring. Other projects I work on include a variety of [Jekyll themes](https://github.com/LeNPaul?tab=repositories&q=a+minimalist+jekyll+theme&type=&language=) that I design, build, and maintain [on GitHub](https://github.com/LeNPaul), as well as a [physics simulation engine](https://github.com/LeNPaul/applepy) built in Python.
