### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


### I'm Paul. I solve problems.

By day, I solve healthcare system integration problems over at [iNTERFACEWARE](https://www.interfaceware.com/), a software company based in Toronto, Canada. As a Solutions Architect, I design, build, test, and deploy various end-to-end solutions that enable the exchange of healthcare data between any system, application, or device at a speed that improves access to critical patient, administrative and financial information.

By night, I try my best to solve what I believe is [a big problem in physics education](https://physicsinmotion.ca/): how to keep students engaged in a beautiful subject that is often stigmatized as being difficult and boring. Other projects I work on include a variety of [Jekyll themes](https://www.lenpaul.com/projects/jekyll-themes.html) that I design, build, and maintain [on GitHub](https://github.com/LeNPaul), as well as a [physics simulation engine](https://www.lenpaul.com/projects/applepy.html) built in Python. I also enjoy [writing blog posts](https://www.lenpaul.com/blog/) on my spare time.

I am always on the lookout for interesting projects to work on and passionate people to work with. If any of [my projects](https://www.lenpaul.com/projects.html) interest you, or if you have any ideas of your own, I would love to [hear from you](https://www.lenpaul.com/contact.html).
